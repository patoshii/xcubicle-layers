  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="accordion">
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Why was Xcubicle Layers created?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The original idea was developed from being able to drop a physical $1 note anywhere in our physical world without restrictions. Nothing stops someone from dropping a $10 note at the bench at a park, the table at a restaurant, or the top of a mountain. Converting that physical $10 note to a virtual one became: “how do you drop a digital coin anywhere in the digital and physical world?”. Using a mix of technologies from cryptographic hashes, web extensions, and cryptocurrencies we can now enable the ability to tie digital tokens of value to anything on the Internet and physical world. With the ability to drop a digital token like Bitcoin on anywhere in the digital world like a webpage, gps location, or without restrictions.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>How does the user know they received this payment?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The campaign owner would get a message on the platform that they received coins and inform them to install the extension to claim it. Eventually we will setup bounties for users to contact these owners and win a reward if they claim it.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Is the service custodial? Who holds the coins that are sent?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>It's not custodial, we don't hold any coins that are sent to the campaign owner. At the time of sending, all coins are coming from the sender's own private key.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Do I need to install the extension to claim my funds?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>No, you don’t. Just fill out the claim form and provide a cryptocurrency address to retrieve the coins. Coins will be forwarded to your address once you verify you own the page of the URL that contains pledges.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>What if the price fluctuates?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>All pledges are in crypto and denominated in the coin they sent regardless of its USD value. For stability, users can send USDC coins which are stable 1 to 1 USD.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Can I get a refund on a transaction?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>No, once a pledge is made, its not reversible like a Bitcoin transaction. Your only option is to remove the funds from your addresses before the transaction is processed and recreate a new account.</p>
