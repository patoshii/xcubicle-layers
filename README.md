## Xcubicle Layers

Layers is an app that lets users send Bitcoin to any website specifically, crowdfunding donation sites like Gofundme and Q&A sites like StackOverflow. Our blockchain-based app adds new payment options, such as Bitcoin, which were not previously available. With this, we are able to cut out middlemen and provide new features not native to the site. Essentially, we have built a new layer on top of the Internet.

## Features

*Pledge Layer*
We've built a method of "pledging" Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on any website directed to a user or owner of the domain regardless if they accept it or not. This new payment layer sits on top of any webpage you visit.

*Notes Layer*
Give users the ability to attach a sticky note to any website. These notes can be used privately for jotting down information when revisiting the same link. Or make them public for anyone to see like a comments section. All notes are stored on a decentralized data cloud encrypted and censorship resistant.


## Installation for Chrome Based Browsers

1. Download this extension as a zip and unzip it. https://github.com/patoshii/xcubicle-layers/archive/master.zip
2. In chrome goto the Extensions page: chrome://extensions then click on "Load Unpacked" and pick the folder with the extension.

## Usage

- Account registration is optional. You can choose Returning User and enter in any email and password to login, but pleding will be disabled. However the notes layers will still work.
- Currently pledging is only supported on Gofundme.com. Other sites like kickstarter.com, stackoverflow.com, linkedin.com, and ebay.com have only demo code implemented. Eventually we will open pledging to any URL.
- Notes can be written on any URL. Everything is stored on the Ardor data cloud. Private notes are only seen by the account holder and public notes are seen by anyone visiting that page.
